    <p>Steps:

    </p>
    <p>1. Choose a Story:</p>
    <p>Find a Mad Libs story that you'd like to complete. It will have blanks labeled with types of words, like nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.</p>
    <p>2. Fill in the Blanks:</p>
    <p>Then enter words into the blanks on the story</p>
    <p>3. Read the Story Aloud:</p>
    <p>Once all the blanks are filled, read the completed story out loud. Prepare for laughs, because the combinations of random words often result in hilarious and silly sentences!</p>
